# Approved Energy Full Stack Developer Test

Thank you for applying to Approved Energy. We're glad to have you in this next round of the process. This assignment is to test your coding skills, micro-project planning, and resource and code management. The assignment states is as follows:

## Plan and implement phase 1 of a three-tier architecture application for a small grocery store. 

### Scope

A new grocery store has just started and would like to maintain it's business digitally. The store would like to maintain records digitally for the following topics

* customers
    * Name
    * Email
    * Address
    * Phone
* Products
    * Name
    * Type 
    * Price
    * Expiration
* Orders
    * customer ID
    * product ID
    * quantity
    * date of purchase

### Technology

A three-tier architecture would consist of the following. Phase one of the app only includes

* Database server
* Back end server

### Database

You're free to choose any database technology you'd prefer (SQL or NoSQL). Database implementation must be portable i.e.

*  If you choose to use a DB server on the client side, the server must be installed on initialization, ready to go
*  If you choose to use a cloud solution, connectivity to the database must be feasible for any client device

### Back End 

You're free to use any framework you'd prefer. Build a REST API to access the above mentioned topics in DB resources. At any point of time, the user must have the capability to add, remove, update or delete any record from any of the tables/documents. 

### Bonus points

Build a front-end application that lets the users access DB resources in a web browser. No authentication is required.

## What we're looking for

This test is designed to guage your 
* Approach to the problem statement: How you go about making decisions and architecting the solution
* coding practice: characteristics like readabilty, reusability, recyclabilty, ease of debugging, etc.
* Packaging your solution: Once submitted, how much effort is it to execute your code?

There's no such thing as the "right" solution. The project is coding language agnostic, you're free to choose languages/frameworks/technologies of your choice. The next interview round will consist of discussion on your solution.

Good luck and happy coding!
